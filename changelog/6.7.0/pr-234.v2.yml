    Generated servers correctly respond 204 for an empty optional response body.

    Server implementations consuming request body of `optional<binary>` (or alias thereof) now use `*io.ReadCloser` for
    the go type of the body argument. Users must update their interface implementations to the new signature and
    intentionally handle when the pointer is nil (i.e. the client sent an absent optional value).
