fix:
  description: 'Reverts the conjure-go behavior change introduced in v6.36.0 to match
    previous versions: certain named imports generated by Conjure code will only be
    generated if the Conjure generator is run twice, but once this is done, the output
    of `conjure.Generate` and `conjure.GenerateOutputFiles` will match, which prevents
    verification issues.'
