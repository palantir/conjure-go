  description: Conjure generated servers now use the `github.com/palantir/conjure-go-runtime/conjure-go-server`
    library for request handling. This change correctly handles conjure error status
    codes and prioritizes them over any legacy error code. It also writes non-json-marshalable
    errors as plaintext with the correct headers.
