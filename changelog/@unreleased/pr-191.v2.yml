  description: Fixes issue where generated Conjure clients and servers did not properly handle empty responses for Conjure
    endpoints returning `optional<binary>`.
    The Conjure specification states that endpoints returning `optional<binary>` should return a 204 status code to
    indicate an empty optional (to distinguish from the case where the response is a present optional of 0 length).
    This change interprets `optional<binary>` as `*ReadCloser` (rather than `ReadCloser') and updates the server to mark
    'nil' responses with a 204 status code. Correspondingly, clients return 'nil' when the response has a 204 status code.
