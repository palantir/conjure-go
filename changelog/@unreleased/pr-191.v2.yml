  description: Fixes issue where generated Conjure clients did not properly handle empty responses from Conjure
    endpoints returning `optional<binary>`. The Conjure specification states that endpoints returning
    `optional<binary>` should return a 204 status code to indicate an empty optional (to distinguish from the case
    where the response is a non-empty optional with 0 bytes), but this was not previously supported by the clients
    generated by conjure-go. This change interprets `optional<binary>` as `*ReadCloser` and returns a `nil` value
    when the response is a 204.
