    If the Conjure IR used for code generation contains product dependency
    information in its extensions block and defines any services, then a
    "zz_generated_product_dependencies.go" file that contains the product
    dependency information is written in the same package as the generated
    service Go files. This makes it so that product dependency information
    for the generated Conjure can be read by other products.
