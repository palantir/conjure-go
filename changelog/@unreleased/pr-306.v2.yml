    - Commands for endpoints with binary args are now supported.
    - Binary args may be provided by file via an `@filepath` notation, stdin via a `@-` notation, and inline as a base64-encoded string
    - Collection and complex type arguments may also be input from file and stdin via the same notation (in addition to as a json-encoded string)
