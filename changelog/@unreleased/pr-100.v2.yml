fix:
  description: |-
    Use palantir/go-ptimports instead of palantir/checks

    Use the non-deprecated project to perform formatting.

    This change also modifies the parameters provided to the formatter,
    which changes the imports in generated code by no longer separating
    project imports into their own block.
