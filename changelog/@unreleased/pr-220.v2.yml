    Reimplement conjure-go using jennifer and updated type system.
    
    The resulting generated code is almost identical to the previous goastwriter implementation.
    Changes include:
      * `alias<binary>` and `optional<binary>` types are handled more correctly in (de)serizalization.
      * Some error messages are improved or wrapped in more context.
      * Some functionally-irrelevant formatting (e.g. import aliases, whitespace).
