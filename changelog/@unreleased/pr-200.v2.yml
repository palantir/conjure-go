    Fixes issue where operation to determine module for Conjure
    output would sometimes fails.

    Adds the "-mod=readonly" flag to the "go list" operation used to
    determine the module for the code generated by Conjure.
    This makes the operation more resilient and is the proper approach for
    this operation, as it is only used to determine the module name.
